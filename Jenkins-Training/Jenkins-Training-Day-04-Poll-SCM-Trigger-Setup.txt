Integrating Jenkins with GitHub – Poll SCM Trigger Setup
=========================================================

Objective:
----------
To configure Jenkins to poll a GitHub repository at regular intervals and trigger a build when changes are detected.

Prerequisites:
--------------
- Jenkins is installed and running.
- A GitHub repository is available.
- Jenkins has the following plugins installed:
  * Git Plugin

Step 1: Create or Open Jenkins Job
----------------------------------
1. Go to Jenkins Dashboard.
2. Click on "New Item" or select an existing Freestyle project.
3. Enter a name and select "Freestyle project", then click "OK".

Step 2: Configure Source Code Management
----------------------------------------
1. Under "Source Code Management", select "Git".
2. Enter your GitHub repository URL:
   Example: https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
3. Add GitHub credentials if necessary.

Step 3: Configure Build Trigger – Poll SCM
------------------------------------------
1. Scroll to the "Build Triggers" section.
2. Check the box for "Poll SCM".
3. In the "Schedule" field, enter a cron syntax to define the polling frequency.
   Example: 
     H/5 * * * *    → Polls every 5 minutes

Cron Format:
------------
MINUTE HOUR DOM MONTH DOW
- H: Distributes the load across time
- *: Every time unit
- Examples:
  - H/15 * * * * : Polls every 15 minutes
  - H 4 * * 1-5  : Polls at 4 AM on weekdays

Step 4: Add Build Step
----------------------
1. In the "Build" section, click "Add build step" > "Execute shell".
2. Add your build commands or scripts, e.g.:
   echo "Code pulled from GitHub, building project..."

Step 5: Save and Test
---------------------
1. Click "Save" to apply the configuration.
2. Make a change in the GitHub repository and push it.
3. Wait for the next polling interval and verify if the build triggers.

Notes:
------
- "Poll SCM" checks for changes but does not create webhooks.
- Suitable for internal Jenkins setups without public access.
- Use cautiously to avoid overloading Jenkins with frequent polling.
