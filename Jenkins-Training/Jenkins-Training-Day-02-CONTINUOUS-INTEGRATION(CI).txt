==============================
CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION (CI) | TIME TO MARKET
==============================

1. WHAT IS CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION (CI)?
---------------------------------------
Continuous Integration is a software development practice where developers regularly merge
their code changes into a shared repository, typically several times a day. Each integration
is automatically verified by an automated build and test process.

KEY BENEFITS:
- Detects errors quickly and early
- Reduces integration problems
- Encourages frequent commits
- Enables faster feedback and testing

HOW CI WORKS:
- Developers push code to version control (e.g., Git)
- CI server (e.g., Jenkins) detects changes
- Automatically builds the code
- Runs unit and integration tests
- Notifies the team of success/failure

---------------------------------------
2. TIME TO MARKET
---------------------------------------
"Time to Market" (TTM) refers to the time it takes to develop a product and make it available
for sale or use. Reducing TTM gives businesses a competitive edge and helps in responding to
market changes quickly.

CI'S IMPACT ON TIME TO MARKET:
- Automates repetitive tasks (builds, tests, deployments)
- Reduces manual errors and rework
- Enables rapid delivery cycles
- Improves code quality through early testing
- Facilitates continuous delivery and deployment

---------------------------------------
3. TOOLS COMMONLY USED FOR CI
---------------------------------------
- Jenkins
- GitLab CI/CD
- CircleCI
- Travis CI
- GitHub Actions

---------------------------------------
4. BEST PRACTICES
---------------------------------------
- Commit code frequently
- Write automated tests
- Keep builds fast
- Use version control properly
- Monitor build results and act quickly

==============================
CONCLUSION
==============================
CI significantly reduces the Time to Market by streamlining and automating the integration,
testing, and deployment process, allowing teams to release faster and with higher confidence.
