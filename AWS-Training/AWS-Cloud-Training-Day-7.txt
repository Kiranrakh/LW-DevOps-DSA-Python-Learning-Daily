============================================
Cloud Storage Services & AWS Storage Types
============================================

1. ‚òÅÔ∏è Storage as a Service (STaaS)
----------------------------------
- STaaS is a cloud computing model where you can **store, manage, and access data** over the internet.
- Eliminates the need for physical storage infrastructure.
- You pay only for the storage you use (pay-as-you-go).
- Common in **cloud platforms** like AWS, Azure, and GCP.

Benefits:
  ‚Ä¢ Scalable
  ‚Ä¢ Secure
  ‚Ä¢ Managed by cloud provider
  ‚Ä¢ Easy backup and disaster recovery

---

2. üì¶ Types of Cloud Storage
----------------------------

A. Block Storage
----------------
- Data is divided into **blocks** and stored in volumes.
- Each block acts as an individual hard drive.
- Ideal for databases, OS storage, and high-performance apps.

Example in AWS: 
üîπ **Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)**

Use Cases:
  ‚Ä¢ EC2 instances
  ‚Ä¢ High-performance workloads
  ‚Ä¢ Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)

---

B. File Storage
---------------
- Stores data in a **hierarchical folder and file format**.
- Accessible through file paths like a local filesystem.
- Shared access to multiple machines.

Example in AWS:
üîπ **Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)**

Use Cases:
  ‚Ä¢ Content management
  ‚Ä¢ Shared files for applications
  ‚Ä¢ Home directories

---

C. Object Storage
------------------
- Stores data as **objects** with metadata and unique identifiers.
- Best suited for storing large amounts of unstructured data.
- Highly durable and scalable.

Example in AWS:
üîπ **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**

Use Cases:
  ‚Ä¢ Backups and archives
  ‚Ä¢ Media storage (images, videos)
  ‚Ä¢ Hosting static websites
  ‚Ä¢ Big data analytics

---

3. üì¶ Amazon EBS ‚Äì Block Storage in AWS
---------------------------------------
- Attach EBS volumes to EC2 instances for **persistent block storage**.
- Types:
  ‚Ä¢ gp3 (General Purpose SSD)
  ‚Ä¢ io2 (Provisioned IOPS SSD)
  ‚Ä¢ sc1 (Cold HDD)
- Automatically replicated within an Availability Zone.

---

4. ü™£ Amazon S3 ‚Äì Object Storage in AWS
---------------------------------------
- Store unlimited data with 11 9's durability (99.999999999%).
- Offers features like:
  ‚Ä¢ Lifecycle policies
  ‚Ä¢ Versioning
  ‚Ä¢ Encryption (SSE)
  ‚Ä¢ S3 Glacier for cold storage

Bucket: Top-level container for storing data.
Object: File + metadata stored inside the bucket.

‚úÖ Summary:
-----------
| Type     | Service | Best For                       |
|----------|---------|--------------------------------|
| Block    | EBS     | Databases, OS Disks, EC2 Vols  |
| File     | EFS     | Shared file systems, NFS       |
| Object   | S3      | Media, backups, web hosting    |

STaaS + AWS = Easy, Scalable, Durable, and Cost-Efficient Storage Management
