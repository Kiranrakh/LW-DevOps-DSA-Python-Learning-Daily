Explanation:
-----------------------------
- Public Subnet has access to Internet Gateway.
- Private Subnet instances can access the internet via NAT (not shown here) or stay isolated.
- ENIs act as virtual NICs for EC2 instances.
- All communication is within the VPC.
- Internet traffic enters via IGW â†’ routed through the public subnet.
- Switches are abstracted in AWS; traffic is routed virtually.

=====================================================

1. Local Area Network (LAN)
------------------------------
- A LAN is a network of interconnected devices within a limited area such as a home, office, or building.
- It enables sharing of resources like files, printers, and internet.
- Example: Your home Wi-Fi connecting your laptop, phone, and printer.

2. Netmask
------------------------------
- A netmask (subnet mask) defines the network and host portions of an IP address.
- Example: 255.255.255.0 means the first 3 octets are network, and the last is host.
- Used in subnetting to split IP ranges.

3. Switch
------------------------------
- A network switch connects devices in a LAN and uses MAC addresses to forward data to the correct destination.
- Operates at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) of the OSI model.
- Switches are more efficient than hubs due to intelligent traffic routing.

4. Router
------------------------------
- A router connects different networks (like LAN to the internet).
- It uses IP addresses to forward data to the correct network.
- Operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer) of the OSI model.

5. Isolated System
------------------------------
- A system that is not connected to any external or public network.
- Used for testing, high-security environments, or internal processes only.
- Also known as air-gapped systems.

6. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
------------------------------
- A virtual network within AWS (or other cloud) that provides isolated space to launch resources.
- You can define subnets, route tables, gateways, and security rules.
- Example: Creating a VPC with public and private subnets for a web application.

7. Elastic Network Interface (ENI)
------------------------------
- A virtual network interface that you can attach to an EC2 instance in AWS.
- It includes IP address, MAC address, and security group info.
- Can be used for fault-tolerant designs (moving ENI to another instance).

8. Internet Gateway (IGW)
------------------------------
- A horizontally scaled, redundant AWS component that allows communication between your VPC and the internet.
- Required for outbound internet traffic from instances in a public subnet.

9. Private and Public IP
------------------------------
- Private IP: Used for internal communication within a VPC or LAN. Not routable over the internet.
  Example: 192.168.0.1, 10.0.0.1
- Public IP: Assigned by your ISP or cloud provider, used to access the internet.
  Example: 15.207.12.5

==============================
 NOTES:
==============================
- Subnetting and proper IP planning are crucial for network design.
- In AWS, combining VPC, Subnets, ENI, IGW, and Route Tables defines your cloud network infrastructure.
- Security Groups and NACLs help control access to/from instances.
