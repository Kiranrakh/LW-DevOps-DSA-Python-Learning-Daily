EC2 pulls image from Docker Hub via NAT Gateway.

No public IP on EC2.

ALB forwards HTTPS traffic to EC2.

ðŸ“Œ STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE
1. Create a VPC
bash
Copy
Edit
VPC CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16
2. Create Subnets
Public Subnet: 10.0.1.0/24

Private Subnet: 10.0.2.0/24

Enable Auto-Assign Public IP only for Public Subnet

3. Internet Gateway + Route Table (for Public Subnet)
Create and attach an Internet Gateway to the VPC.

Route Table:

0.0.0.0/0 â†’ Internet Gateway

Associate with Public Subnet

4. NAT Gateway (for Private EC2)
In Public Subnet:

Allocate and associate an Elastic IP

Launch NAT Gateway

Route Table for Private Subnet:

0.0.0.0/0 â†’ NAT Gateway

5. Launch Bastion Host (in Public Subnet)
Amazon Linux 2

Assign public IP

Open port 22 (SSH) from your IP

Save the Key Pair (e.g., bastion.pem)

6. Launch EC2 (in Private Subnet)
Amazon Linux 2

NO public IP

Security Group:

Inbound: allow port 5000 (or 80) from ALB Security Group only

Save the Key Pair (e.g., private.pem)

7. Create Application Load Balancer (ALB)
Scheme: internet-facing

Subnets: public subnets (across AZs)

Security Group:

Inbound: allow port 443 from anywhere

Listener:

HTTPS â†’ Target Group (port 5000)

Target Group:

Register your private EC2

Health check path: /

8. SSH into EC2 via Bastion Host
From local:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh -i bastion.pem ec2-user@<Bastion-Public-IP>
From Bastion to Private EC2:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh -i private.pem ec2-user@<Private-EC2-Private-IP>
9. Install Docker on Private EC2
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install docker -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user
exit  # Then reconnect via SSH again
10. Pull and Run Docker Image from Docker Hub
Example image: yourdockerhub/myapp:latest

bash
Copy
Edit
docker pull yourdockerhub/myapp:latest

# Run the container (assuming app runs on port 5000)
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name myapp yourdockerhub/myapp:latest
11. Verify ALB Access
Open browser â†’ https://<ALB-DNS-Name>

You should see your app running.

âœ… Security Best Practices

Component	Best Practice
EC2	No public IP, access only via Bastion
Docker Image	Pulled over NAT gateway from Docker Hub
ALB	Handles all public traffic, enforces HTTPS
SG	EC2 allows only ALB; ALB allows only 443
SSH	Restricted by IP and key
