👥 Team Members & Questions:



1. **Kiran Rakh**
   - Q1: What are the advantages of NumPy arrays over Python lists?
     - 🏢 Asked in: Capgemini
     - 🔗 Reference: https://www.ambitionbox.com/interviews/capgemini-question/what-are-the-advantages-of-numpy-arrays-over-python-lists-jpH0EHXb
     - ✅ Answer:
 
Homogeneity: NumPy arrays can only contain elements of the same data type, whereas Python lists can store elements of different types.

Performance: NumPy arrays support vectorized operations, making them faster for numerical computations.

Memory Efficiency: NumPy arrays consume less memory due to their contiguous memory allocation.

   - Q2: What is the default color format used by OpenCV when reading an image?
     - 🏢 Asked in: Adaface
     - 🔗 Reference: https://www.adaface.com/blog/open-cv-interview-questions/
     - ✅ Answer: 


OpenCV uses the BGR (Blue, Green, Red) color format by default when reading an image. This is different from the more commonly used RGB (Red, Green, Blue) format.

3. **Bhushan Yadav**
   - Q1: What is an Interpreted language?
     - 🏢 Asked in: Wipro
     - 🔗 Reference: 
     - ✅ Answer: 

 An Interpreted language executes its statements line by line. Languages such as Python, Javascript, R, PHP, and Ruby are prime examples of Interpreted languages

   - Q2: What is a dynamically typed language?
     - 🏢 Asked in:  TCS
     - 🔗 Reference: 
     - ✅ Answer: 

An language in which we do not need to define the type of data. such as Python
Type-checking can be done at two stages -

Static - Data Types are checked before execution.
Dynamic - Data Types are checked during execution.

4. **Gaurav Patil**
   - Q1:  What are the differences between Python lists and NumPy arrays?
     - 🏢 Asked in: 
     - 🔗 Reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/numpy-interview-questions/ 
     - ✅ Answer: 

Python lists can store heterogeneous data types and are flexible but
slower for numerical computations. NumPy arrays are homogeneous, memoryefficient, and support vectorized operations, making them faster for numerical

   - Q2: How do you convert a Pandas DataFrame to a NumPy array?
     - 🏢 Asked in: 
     - 🔗 Reference: https://www.interviewbit.com/numpy-interview-questions/ 
     - ✅ Answer: 

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2], 'B': [3, 4]})
numpy_array = df.to_numpy()

5. **Manasi Patil**
   - Q1: What advantages do NumPy arrays offer over (nested) Python lists?
     - 🏢 Asked in: 
     - 🔗 Reference: https://t.me/placementdrive_pld  
     - ✅ Answer: 

1. Speed (Performance)
NumPy arrays are much faster than Python lists, especially for large datasets.
2. Memory Efficiency
NumPy arrays take less memory compared to lists.
3. Convenient for Mathematical Operations.

   - Q2: What are Python Libraries?
     - 🏢 Asked in: 
     - 🔗 Reference: https://t.me/placementdrive_pld 
     - ✅ Answer: 
Python libraries are a collection of Python packages. Some of the majorly used python libraries are Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn and many more.
