             DevOps & Kubernetes Interview Questions with Answers
==================================================================================

Basic Questions (Self and Project)
--------------------------------------------------
1. Tell me about yourself.
- I am a DevOps enthusiast skilled in AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD, currently seeking full-time opportunities.

2. Explain any project you have worked on.
- I deployed a three-tier application using Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins on AWS.

3. What challenges did you face during your project and how did you solve them?
- Faced container networking issues; resolved by implementing correct CNI plugins and services.

Kubernetes Questions
--------------------------------------------------
4. What is the difference between NodePort and LoadBalancer services?
- NodePort exposes services on node IP and a static port; LoadBalancer provisions an external IP via cloud providers.

5. Explain how networking works in Kubernetes.
- Each Pod gets its own IP; communication is managed by Services and network plugins (CNI) without NAT.

6. What is a StatefulSet? Why do we use it?
- Manages stateful applications by maintaining a unique identity and persistent storage for each Pod.

7. What is a DaemonSet? When should we use it?
- Ensures a copy of a Pod runs on all (or selected) nodes; used for node monitoring, logging, etc.

8. What are different types of Kubernetes Services?
- ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, and ExternalName.

9. What is a namespace in Kubernetes and why do we use it?
- Namespace partitions cluster resources for better management, isolation, and multi-team environments.

10. What security measures have you implemented in Kubernetes?
- Used RBAC, Secrets Management, NetworkPolicies, Pod Security Standards, and TLS encryption.

11. What is a NetworkPolicy in Kubernetes?
- Defines rules for ingress and egress traffic between Pods to enhance network security.

DevOps General Questions
--------------------------------------------------
12. What is CI/CD? Explain any pipeline you built.
- CI/CD automates integration, testing, and deployment. I built a Jenkins pipeline that built Docker images, pushed them to ECR, and deployed to EKS.

13. What is Infrastructure as Code? Which tools have you used?
- Managing infrastructure through code scripts. I used Terraform to provision AWS resources.

14. Explain the concept of GitOps.
- GitOps uses Git repositories as the source of truth to automate deployment through pull requests.

15. How does Terraform work?
- Terraform uses HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) to define and provision infrastructure in a declarative manner.

16. What is Jenkins? How do you create a Jenkins pipeline?
- Jenkins is a CI/CD tool. Pipelines are created using a Jenkinsfile which defines stages like build, test, and deploy.

AWS/Cloud Related Questions
--------------------------------------------------
17. What are Security Groups and IAM roles in AWS?
- Security Groups are virtual firewalls for instances; IAM roles grant temporary access permissions to AWS services.

18. Explain Load Balancer in AWS.
- Distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets (like EC2 instances) to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

Bonus Kubernetes Question
--------------------------------------------------
19. What is the difference between Deployment and StatefulSet?
- Deployment manages stateless applications where Pods are identical. StatefulSet manages stateful apps where each Pod maintains a unique identity and persistent storage.
